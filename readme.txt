In the previous exercise, we added some files to our empty Git repo, and
then we used the Git add Cmd to then stage those files. So, of course,
the next step that once you have all the files staged that you want for
your next commit, the next step is to go ahead, and do the commit
itself. And that's taking that sort of snapshot of the project. At that
moment in time. Now my terminal window here is kind of mess so I'm going
to type in the world clear and that's just going to clear off all the
cruft from the screen. Now a lot of times I'll come in and I'll want to
make a commit and I'll open up my terminal window and I'll say okay,
what's the current status of the project.

So, again, we know that all we have to do is type in Get Status, and
we'll get that feedback. So I recommend doing Get Status before every
single commit, because it tells you what's going to happen in a
snapshot. And maybe this looks exactly the way you want it to, maybe it
doesn't. So I can actually see there are all of the files that are being
committed, and actually right here it says use get remove dash, dash
cached and then the name of the file to upstage, so if there is one of
these and your like oh man I didn't mean to commit the CSS yet you could
remove that from the stage area if you want so remember this is just the
staging are.

Now it's ready to commit. So in order to do your first commit, it's a
very simple command. Git>Space>Commit, that is it. You hit Return, and
something weird's going to happen. As I mentioned to you guys before,
I'm not a command line warrior. This is not where I spend most of my
time. I'm in graphics editors or, you know, Brackets, or a code editor
or something like that. I don't spend a whole lot of time on the command
line. So I'm going to be totally forthright, and honest with you guys
here. When I first started learning it, for the very first time, when I
started noodling down and learned it, this threw me. Because I'm not in
the terminal window anymore. I'm in a text editor called Them, well I
didn't know that.

And I kept trying to type in as if I were in Terminal, and everything
started messing up. So you can actually see title bar at the window up
there it says Git basics dash Them. So I'm actually in a them, which is
a text editor. So when you do a commit, and you don't specify anything
else, when you just do a basic Git Cmd the way we just did it. Git says
oh, okay, well you have to write a message. And that message for your
commit typically has a status line that explains, you know, it's kind of
a short title of the message. And then a longer message body that gives
a little bit more detail about what's going on in the commit. This is a
really important process to the commit, because you need to explain
fully what's happening in that snapshot.

Now, what I'm going to do here, is I'm going to type in initial commit
right up there at the top. Now all that stuff underneath it, you can
just ignore it because all of that is going to be removed because it has
a hash in front of it. So it's kind of like a comment, if you will, in
normal text editors. It will be ignored. This is just a message to you,
dear reader, to help you understand what's happening, and what you'll
need to do. So it tells you the are going to be committed, that sort of
thing. Now if I hit return a couple of times. I can come down here and
then I'm going to type in this is my initial commit in my new Git repo
it's going great so far.

Exclamation point because I'm very excited about it. All right so that's
all that's going to be stored in the message. All the stuff below it
will be thrown away. Now. I'm in the vim editor and I need to get out of
the vim editor, and to do that I'm going to type in escape. And then a
colon, and then a WQ, which will write and save the file. There are
other commands you could use, if you know them very well, there's like a
couple of different keystrokes that'll get you out of that. But I gotta
tell you something, the very first time I did that, that one took me a
while to kind of figure out how to get back to what I was doing. All
right. If you hate them like me, you don't have to do it that way.

Before we move on to committing in a slightly more efficient manner.
Take a look at what just happened. You'll notice that right above the
cursor I have some confirmation about my initial commit. So my initial
commit was made. I had seven files changed, 230 insertions, it shows me
all the files that were committed. And, so I get a nice rundown of
everything that got added to that particular snapshot. So we created a
new commit. and all of those files were added to it. That means if I run
get status right now, you'll notice that it says there's nothing to
commit. The working directory is clean. That means we've just taken a
snapshot.

And right now the working directory looks exactly like the snapshot.
There have been no changes made to that. Well I'm going to change that.
Now I don't like using Vim, so I'm going to use another text editor, I'm
going to open up text edit. Now in text edit, really, you can open up
any plain, text editor to do what we're about to do. We're going to
create a readme file for our project. And you want to just open up a
generic text editor that allows you to create plain text files. What I'm
going to do at the top of this is I'm going to type in get basics. And
then a couple of lines below that I'm going to type in I'm learning the
basics of Git and GitHub.

So this repo is really just for experimenting. All right, I'm going to
go ahead and save that. And I'm going to save that to my desktop, to my
repos, in the Git basics. And here I'm just going to save this as
readme.txt. Now you want to make sure that this is a plain text, not
rich text, just a plain text file. I'm going to save that. Okay now,
since we have now created a new file, and saved it into that repo, if I
run and get status now, I can see that there is one untracked file.

We added a file that is not currently being tracked. So to track that,
remember how easy this was, we type in get add. And then we can do the
name of the file, read me.txt. So that stages it, and if I do get status
again, it tells me, okay everything's good, but we have a new file
that's been moved to the staging area, and it's ready to be committed.
So I'm going to do another commit to follow up our initial commit, it's
going to add read me file. But this time I don't to want to go into the
vin text editor. Well if you are making a commit, and you have just a
really short message that you want to pass on, it's really easy to do that.

In one command. So I'm going to type in Git commit space dash m for
message, and then another space, and then quotation marks, you can type
in whatever message you want. And this time, I'm going to type in, added
a readme file. So you want it to be very descriptive. So again, it's Git
space commit space dash m space, and then the commit message. So this
saves you from firing up the Vim editor and if you hit return, you
notice that when you made the commit. And it inserted our readme.txt
file. Perfect! So we now have two commits, each one of them the result
of tracking some new files.

And next, we're going to explore how to deal with files that have been
modified from the previous commit.

        Q: Why can't I create a .nojekyll file?

A: Depending upon your operating system and platform, you may have
certain restrictions which make it impossible to create a .nojekyll file
through Finder or Windows Explorer. Usually you’ll receive an error
message that informs you that files starting with a “.” are system files
and that you lack the permissions necessary to create one. If that’s the
case, you’ll need to create the file through a Terminal window or bash
prompt. Here’s how you do it:

    1.	Open a Terminal window if you’re on a Mac, or the bash prompt from
    the Github client if you’re on Windows. 
    2.	Navigate to the repository’s root directory.
    3.	Type the following at the prompt: $ touch .nojekyll
    4.	That’s it! The next time you make a commit and push to the master
    branch you should see your new .nojekyll file.
