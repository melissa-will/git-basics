For the ganache:

Instructions
To make the chocolate cake:
 
1.     Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Butter three 8" round cake pans, line them with parchment paper, and butter the parchment, Dust the parchment with flour and knock out the excess.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cocoa, sour cream and hot coffee or water until smooth. Set aside to cool.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. In a bowl beat the butter and sugars together on medium high speed until very light and creamy, scraping the bowl down as necessary, about 5-7 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing after each. Add the vanilla.
5. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the cooled cocoa mixture, ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined. Divide the batter equally between the prepared cake pans.
6. Bake, rotating halfway through. until the center of the the cakes bounce back when touched and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 35 - 40 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
To make the coffee buttercream:  I used ingredient amounts in this cake recipe but used instructions from the Ermine Buttercream recipe below.
 
To assemble the cake:
7. If desired, cut the cooled cake layers in half, creating more layers. Place the first cake layer on a cake stand or plate. Cover with buttercream and top with another cake layer. Repeat.
8. Cover the layer cake with a thin layer of buttercream to create a crumb coat. Chill cake for 10 minutes to set, then cover with remaining buttercream. Chill for at least 30 minutes.
To make the ganache:
9. Place the chopped chocolate, cubed butter, and corn syrup in a large heat-proof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir as mixture melts. Once smooth, remove from heat and let cool for about 5 minutes.
10. Pour about 1/2 cup of the ganache over the top of the chilled cake, spreading it just to the edge without letting it spill over the sides. Chill 5 minutes. Pour another 1/2-1 cup of the ganache over the cake, this time pushing it over the sides and letting it drip down. Let cake set for 30 minutes at room temperature or 10 minutes in the fridge before serving.

A few notes about this recipe:
>> When making the cake, it’s very important that you sufficiently cream the butter and sugars together before proceeding. It affects both the rise and texture.
>> The buttercream recipe is a bit unusual at first glance.  Butter is whipped into a pseudo pastry cream, creating a frosting that is light and dreamlike.
>> The success of the buttercream is largely determined by the temperature of the butter. It should be at room temperature and soft enough that your finger will leave an imprint when pressed, but not so soft that your finger easily presses through it.
>> If the buttercream is liquidy try chilling it in the fridge in 10 minute intervals to stiffen the butter. After 10 minutes, try beating it again. If necessary, chill for another 10 minutes.
>> Very moist cake so will break apart easily.  Be careful transferring it and best to cool in refrigerator or freezer before icing it.  I put the cake in the freezer until I was ready to assemble it.  Bake the cake a day or two before in order to have a chilled product to spread the icing on.  If you assemble the cake a day in advance let it come to room temperature up to an hour before serving.  I did use the parchment paper method because I read in several recipes how easily the cake could break apart.  In fact, the cake took its shape from the parchment paper so I did have to trim the cake once I put the layers together in order to have a better shape before putting on the buttercream.
>>Use three 8 inch cake pans or, two 9 or 10 inch cake pan, otherwise you will have leftover batter.
>> Use less expresso powder unless you want a very coffee intense flavored cake.


Vanilla Flour Buttercream (or Ermine Buttercream)
 
Makes about 620g (or 3¼ cup) of buttercream, enough to generously frost about 12 cupcakes or a two-layered 20-cm (8-inch) cake. 
 
Ingredients
* 35g (or 4½ tablespoons) all-purpose flour
* 200g (or 1 cup) granulated sugar
* pinch of salt
* 240ml (or 1 cup) milk
* 226g (or 1 cup) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature*
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
Instructions
1. Combine flour, sugar and salt in a medium-sized saucepan. Whisk together. Add the milk and whisk until combined.
2. Place saucepan over low heat and allow the mixture to come to a boil, whisking continuously. Once the mixture starts bubbling, cook for 1-2 minutes, then take the pan off the heat and whisk for a minute to beat some of the heat out of the pudding. About 10 minutes or so total.
3. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the pudding onto a clean plate and immediately cover it with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic wrap directly onto the pudding. This keeps a skin from forming. Allow the pudding to cool to room temperature.
4. Once the pudding has cooled, beat the butter in a medium-sized bowl until smooth and fluffy and lightened in color, 5-7 minutes.
5. Add the cooled pudding one tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition. Once all the pudding has been added, mix for another few minutes, until the buttercream looks thick, smooth and creamy. Add the vanilla and mix briefly to combine.
6. Finally, use a rubber spatula to smush the buttercream against the sides of the bowl (aka: stir vigorously for about a minute) to get rid of any large air bubbles. This makes piping the buttercream a lot easier.
7. Use immediately or store, covered in the fridge, for up to seven days. Before you want to use it, allow buttercream to come to room temperature and mix briefly until smooth and creamy again.
8. Buttercream can also be frozen in a zip-lock bag for up to two months. Allow to thaw in the fridge overnight, then allow to come to room temperature and mix until smooth and fluffy before use.
9. Frosted cakes or cupcakes stay fresh, stored in an airtight container in the fridge, for up to three days. Allow to come to room temperature before serving.
Notes
* I usually take the butter out of the fridge 30 minutes before I want to start mixing.
